  <section id="about">
    <h2>Who am I</h2>
    <p>I'm a highly motivated cybersecurity student currently making a transition into the IT industry. I come from a hands-on background as a technician, with experience working on enterprise-level servers. Over time, I’ve been sharpening my technical skills through self-directed learning and home labs, focusing on virtual machines and cloud management. I have a genuine passion for technology and continuous improvement, and I’m always eager to learn and take on new challenges. I adapt quickly and thrive in fast-paced, dynamic environments, and I’m excited to contribute my growing expertise and strong troubleshooting abilities to a team where I can make an impact.
</p>
  </section>

  <section id="experience">
    <h2>Work Experience</h2>
    <p>Over the course of my career, I’ve built a diverse background rooted in hands-on technical work and direct service. I began in the medical field, where I spent 12 years at the University of Miami in various roles—from CNA to administrative support—developing a strong foundation in protocols, attention to detail, and working in high-pressure environments like operating rooms.
After more than a decade in healthcare, I decided it was time for a change. I’ve always had a curiosity for technology, so I made a career pivot. I took on a locksmith role as a stepping stone, where I gained valuable experience using tools, working with precision, and understanding physical security systems. That naturally led me into the low voltage field with DML Security, where I worked for six years planning and installing systems like access control, surveillance, and network infrastructure. I managed wire runs, programmed IPs, maintained HOA properties, and even helped train over 10 new technicians.
Along the way, I started to realize that my interest was evolving toward digital security. I saw how physical and digital security intersect, and that inspired me to dive deeper. I completed the Google Cybersecurity Certificate and a Cybersecurity course from the University of Miami to build my knowledge in IT and cybersecurity best practices.
Unfortunately, due to a shift in management at DML, I felt my growth was limited, which pushed me to finally make the full leap into the IT world. Now, I’m excited and fully prepared to take on a new role as an IT professional—bringing not just technical skills, but also adaptability, discipline, and a passion for security.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="goals">
    <h2>Goals & Expectations</h2>
    <p>At this stage in my career, my primary goal is continuous learning and skill development. I'm deeply committed to expanding my technical expertise, particularly in cybersecurity, cloud infrastructure, and network systems. I want to be in an environment where I can absorb knowledge from experienced professionals, stay updated with evolving technologies, and apply what I learn to real-world challenges.
In the long term, I aim to use my growing skill set to help small and medium-sized businesses adopt and integrate technology more effectively. I believe that with the right tools and guidance, these companies can operate more securely, efficiently, and competitively. My expectation is to be part of a team that values innovation, mentorship, and collaboration—where I can contribute meaningfully while continuing to grow into a strong, reliable IT professional</p>
  </section>

  <section id="tech">
    <h2>Why I Like Technology</h2>
    <p>I’ve always been fascinated by how technology shapes the world around us, and I truly believe it’s the future—impacting everything from how we communicate to how we secure our most critical data. What draws me in most is how fast it evolves, and how there’s always something new to learn or improve.
Specifically, cybersecurity and ethical hacking have become a major focus for me. I see them as some of the most valuable and in-demand skills of the 21st century. As we continue to rely more on digital systems, the need to protect that information becomes not just important, but essential. I love the idea of being on the front lines—helping organizations stay secure, identifying vulnerabilities before bad actors do, and ensuring that technology continues to serve people safely. That challenge and responsibility are what excite me most about this field.</p>
