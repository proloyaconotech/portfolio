    <h2>Secure Multi-Site AD Environment with GPOs and Replication</h2>
    <p class="project-summary">
      This project simulates a real-world enterprise environment using virtual machines, Active Directory, and pfSense routing.
     It demonstrates my ability to configure multi-site domain controllers, enforce Group Policy.
     Technologies used: VMware Workstation Pro, Windows Server 2022, pfSense (firewall/router), Windows 11 Pro (domain-joined client).
